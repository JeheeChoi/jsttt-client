# J's TTT(Tic Tac Toe) : By C3

This Tic Tac Toe Single Page Application allows the user to complete the basic authentication activities and play tic tac toe game. 
Through this project, I wanted to make sure that I am fully understanding how SPA works with API, and I can utilize HTML/CSS, JavaScript I learned for the last 3 weeks.

## Planning Story

For this 4 day project, I planned on following the suggested schedule, working step by step using a local server. 

- Day 1 - Working on sign-in/sign-up/change pw/sign out features on my SPA. 
- Day 2 - Working on game API - game function
- Day 3 - Building the game logic using pseudocode
- Day 4 - Working on styling of the webpage while keep working on the game functionality

### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign up/sign in/sign out
- As a user I want to update(change)my password 
- As a user I want to play games
- As a user I want to restart a game
- As a user I want to see how many games Iâ€™ve played previously

### Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

### Unsolved Problems

- I still need to update/organize page layout
- I would like to eventually add a creative spin for my tic tac toe game to be more enjoyable.
