## Planning Story

For this 4 day project, I planned on following the suggested schedule, working step by step: Index.html-app.js-events.js-ui.js using a local server. Day 1 was great by making good progress on sign-in/sign-up/change pw/sign out features on my SPA. But on day 2, I adjusted my project schedule a little bit in order to make the features work together with each other.(ex. Update games/Show games/Play games). On Day 3 I built the game logic using pseudocode, commented every single line as I wrote the game engine function. On day 4, I worked on a little bit of styling of my webpage, made it look simple and clean but focused on my game functionality. 

### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign up/sign in/sign out
- As a user I want to update(change)my password 
- As a user I want to play games
- As a user I want to restart a game
- As a user I want to see how many games Iâ€™ve played previously

### Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS
- jQuery
- Bootstrap

### Unsolved Problems

- I still need to update/organize page layout
- I would like to eventually add a creative spin for my tic tac toe game to be more enjoyable.
