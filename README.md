# J's TTT(Tic Tac Toe) : By C3

This Tic Tac Toe Single Page Application allows the user to complete the basic authentication activities and play tic tac toe game. 
Through this project, I wanted to make sure that I am fully understanding how SPA works with API, and I can utilize HTML/CSS, JavaScript I learned for the last 3 weeks.

## Planning Story & Development Process

For this 4 day project, I planned on following the suggested schedule, working step by step using a local server. 

- Day 1 - Working on sign-in/sign-up/change pw/sign out features on my SPA. 
- Day 2 - Working on game API - game function
- Day 3 - Building the game logic using pseudocode
- Day 4 - Working on styling of the webpage while keep working on the game functionality

During the project my schedule's got adjusted as:

- Day 1 - Understanding the game project and reading the project requirement
- Day 2 - Understanding the API and the relationship with the SPA, slowly building event listeners & handlers
- Day 3 - I had a hard time writing down game logic, couldn't make any progress without help. then, I started using psuedocode method - added comments on each line
- Day 4 - As I make a progress, I was keep getting into another issue/bug problem
- Extra days - My game project was not complete by day 4, I worked on styling a bit but kept working on the game function


### User Stories

- As a user I want to see how many games Iâ€™ve played previously

### Technologies Used
